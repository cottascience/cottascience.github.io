## About

Hi! I'm a Postdoc Fellow @ [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I received my PhD degree in Computer Science @ Purdue University, where I was advised by Prof. [Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/). Before that ---in a distant and happy land--- I was a B.Sc. student (also in CS) @ UFMG, Brazil. During my time as a B.Sc. student I worked with distributed algorithms (@ UFMG) and Quantum Computing Theory (@ University of Calgary).
