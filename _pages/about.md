## About

Hi! I'm a Postdoc Fellow at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I received my PhD degree in Computer Science at Purdue University, where I was advised by Prof. [Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/). Before that ---in a distant and happy land--- I was a B.Sc. student (also in CS) at UFMG, Brazil. During my time as a B.Sc. student I worked with distributed algorithms (UFMG) and Quantum Computing Theory (University of Calgary).
