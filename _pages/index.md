# üí¨ About

I'm a postdoc fellow at¬†[Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), where I'm hosted by¬†[Chris J. Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/). I received my PhD degree in computer science at Purdue University, where I was advised by¬†[Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/). Before that **‚Äî**in a distant and happy land**‚Äî** I was a BSc student (also in CS) at UFMG, Brazil. During my time as an undergrad I worked with distributed algorithms (at UFMG) and quantum computing theory (at University of Calgary).

# üìù¬†Research

I develop machine learning and  causal inference methods for applications in science and healthcare,.
My long-term goal is to discover new treatments for diseases with high unmet medical needs and implement intelligent health systems. To this end, my work contributes algorithms and models that can leverage diverse, complex data to discover, evaluate, deliver, and monitor therapeutic and policy interventions.
