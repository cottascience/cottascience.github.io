## About

Hi! I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science @ Purdue University. Previously, I was a B.Sc. student (also in CS) @ UFMG, Brazil.

My interests lie in Machine Learning and Theoretical Computer Science. More specifically, I'm interested in the design and optimization of statistical models for discrete structures, e.g. graphs. Previously, I worked with IoT (@ UFMG) and Quantum Computing theory (@ University of Calgary).

The best way to read about my research is going to [my GoogleScholar profile](https://goo.gl/zrNQue). I try to maintain my repositories here at Github as up to date as possible. If you don't find what you are looking for here or if you have any extra questions about my research, do not hesitate to email me!
