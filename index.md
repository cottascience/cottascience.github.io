_Research Scientist, Ellison Institute of Technology_

I'm a computer scientist building and studying AI systems for real-world impact. Mostly focused on medicine and the life sciences.

Simple systems paired with complex data and large flop counts give life to beautiful things. It's our time, so let's build for humanity's most enduring challenges.

Current (general) interests:
* generative models for discrete data;
* causal inference;
* uncertainty & data curation;
* scaling laws on scientific and medical data.

## Collabs

Big on open science, open source, and free education.

If you want to build something together (research or outreach), shoot me an email. For longer term collaborations, consider applying to one of our PhD programs: [Ellison Scholarships](https://eit.org/scholars), or the [AI Fundamentals CDT](https://www.eitcdt.ox.ac.uk/). Particularly hyped about working with folks from diverse backgrounds & communities.
