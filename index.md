## Leonardo Cotta

Hi! I'm a 1st year PhD student in Computer Science @ Purdue University. Previously, I was a B.Sc. student (also in CS) @ UFMG, Brazil.

My interests lie in Machine Learning, Theoretical Computer Science and Information Theory. Previously, I worked with IoT and Quantum Computing theory (at the University of Calgary).

Right now, I don't have the time (and the material) to build a decent Website. If you don't find what you are looking for here, don't hesitate to email me, I usually reply in one day.

The best way to read about my research is going to [My GoogleScholar Profile](https://goo.gl/zrNQue). If you want access to some code or data, email me!

[ NOTE ] I will make this Website better soon!
