# 💬 About

I'm a postdoc fellow at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), where I'm hosted by [Chris J. Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/). I received my PhD degree in computer science at Purdue University, where I was advised by [Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/). Before that ---in a distant and happy land--- I was a BSc student (also in CS) at UFMG, Brazil. During my time as an undergrad I worked with distributed algorithms (at UFMG) and quantum computing theory (at University of Calgary).

# 📝 Research

I'm broadly interested in statistical and causal machine learning. More specifically, I study the interplay between symmetries, computation, and learning. How can we leverage these concepts to build better (and practical) machine learning methodology? I believe these insights are specially relevant in problems with complex systems' data. Inspired by this, more recently I have been considering problems with applications in biochemistry.
